# How to compile and run the C++ program?

Once you've got your compiler and source program ready, it is very easy to compile and run a C++ program. Assuming that you've installed GCC compiler, and you have a source.cpp file that you want to compile, follow the following instructions to compile and run it.

<sub> 

**Step 1** − Open a new terminal window or cmd if you are on windows.
    
**Step 2** − Change the directory to the directory in which you have your source.cpp file. For example, if it is in C:/Users/Dell/Documents, enter your command line −
                
               $ cd 'C:/Users/yoxmo/Documents'
               
**Step 3** − Now enter the following command to compile the source file using g++.

              $ g++ -o <name-of-program> source.cpp

              In place of <name-of-program> replace it by any name like myprogram, etc.

**Step 4** − Run it! Now you can run the program using −

              $ ./<name-of-program>
